#Coursera Practical Machine Learning Project

This repository contains my solution to the project of the course
Practical Machine Learning of the 
Coursera Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization 


Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, **THE GOAL**  will be to use data from **ACCELEROMETERS** on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
